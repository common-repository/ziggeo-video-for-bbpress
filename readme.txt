== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does it work? =

The plugin combines and extends the reach of Ziggeo plugin to your bbPress forum. In old ages people would share the links to their videos on various platforms. Often videos get removed, or moved and you end up with different or missing content. With Ziggeo powered recorders and player it is quick, simple and easy to add video to your bbPress forum. Plus it allows you to keep in control of your content.

By installing this plugin it offers you few options that allow you to set up how Ziggeo core plugin is used on your bbPress plugin pages.

= Where does integration happen? =

This plugin allows you to pick where the plugin will be integrated to. By default you will allow all community members that see the form to also be able to add the videos into their replies. It is quick and simple and there are many options. From screen recording, video and just audio.

All you have to do is to set and enjoy it :)
